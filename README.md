# 🎲 Snake and Ladders Game

A classic **Snake and Ladders** game developed as an academic mini project to demonstrate programming logic, conditional flow, and game-based problem solving.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Snake and Ladders Game** is a digital implementation of the traditional board game where players roll a dice and move forward based on the outcome. Snakes reduce the player’s position, while ladders help the player advance faster.

This project focuses on implementing **game logic, randomization, and rule-based movement**, making it an ideal beginner-friendly programming project.
